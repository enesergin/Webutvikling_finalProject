				<span>Humanity is facing one of its greatest challenges right now – the climate crisis. The climate changes, such as global warming, are primarily due to human activities. <br><br>

				The arising issue is “How to make it easier to act sustainably?”. From a social viewpoint, it can be difficult to keep track of sustainable and unsustainable products. This results in being more challenging to act sustainably. <br><br>

				From a technological perspective, the challenge is to sort the given information. The application makes it easier to collect necessary information in one place.  <br><br>

				Since the human activity has had a huge negative impact on the environment, we can not disregard the great potential we as humans have, to stop the climate changes.

					As a member, you collect points every time you a sustainable product, and after a number of specific points you will get discount on your favorite products.  <br>
					Our solution is based on independent work with an initiative to help both the environment and the people in the society. The evidence of our creative and relevant work is in our solution.

				To create this product and service, we are collaborating with companies we trust based on research and meetings.
				 It is important for us to ensure that our partners have the same vision as us and also operate in a sustainable way.

The challenge occurs when the production happens abroad where it could be different working requirements and conditions.
Since safety and environment primarily is our focus, we are making sure that the regulations are in accordance to the Norwegian law.
 Nevertheless, our partners are mostly local. If they are abroad, they are certified in schemes with strict rules.
