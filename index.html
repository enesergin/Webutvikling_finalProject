			<p class = info-top>Why Is The Problem Relevant?</p>
			<div class="info-text">
			<p>There is no reason to make a service for the sake of it. It is of great importance to create something that is needed or would make a difference in society. <br><br> As a team the 12th sustainable goal was something we wanted to fight towards. While brainstorming we realised that we ourselves had struggles with choosing ecological products. <br><br> Therefore, we created a survey to get an idea of how we could help the people of Norway choose sustainable, and whether that was something they needed or not.</p>
