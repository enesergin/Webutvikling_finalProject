			<p>Why is the problem relevant?</p>
			<div class="info-text">
			<p>There is no reason to make a service for the sake of it. It is of great importance to create something that is needed or would make difference in society. As a team the 12th. sustainable goal was something we wanted to fight towards. While brainstorming we realised that we ourselves had struggles with choosing ecological products. Therefor, we created a survey to get an idea of how we could help the people of Norway choose sustainable and whether that was something they needed.</p>
