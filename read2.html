			<h2 class="readinnholdtittel">The Challenge</h2>
			<p class="readinnholdtekst">Humanity is facing one of its greatest challenges right now – the climate crisis. The climate changes, such as global warming, are primarily due to human activities.<br><br>
				The arising issue is “How to make it easier to act sustainably?”. From a social viewpoint, it can be difficult to keep track of sustainable and unsustainable products. This results in being more challenging to act sustainably.<br><br>
				From a technological perspective, the challenge is to sort the given information. The application makes it easier to collect necessary information in one place.<br><br>
				Since the human activity has had a huge negative impact on the environment, we can not disregard the great potential we as humans have, to stop the climate changes.</p>

			<h2 class="readinnholdtittel">Our Solution</h2>
			<p class="readinnholdtekst">By sustainable production, we are able to reduce the environmental damage due to gas emissions and irresponsible consumption. <br><br>
				Our solution is presented to you with our LexEco application. The application is universally designed with the ease of usability in mind. <br><br>
				By downloading our application and joining the LexEco family, you will ensure that the products you consume are all sustainable. <br><br>
				Lexeco is a free barcode-scanner for your device. By using your device´s camera, the barcode-scanner will automatically recognize if the product is sustainable or not, applying to both the materials and the production. If the product you want to buy is unsustainable, sustainable options will appear on the screen. <br><br>
				Our solution is based on independent work with an initiative to help both the environment and society.</p>
